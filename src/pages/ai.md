description: "My approach to using AI tools in writing and development work"
---

I use AI when I need to look something up that would be tedious to hunt down manually (deep research mode). Also use it for tentative outlines when I'm staring at a blank page and need structure. It's good at getting me unstuck.

As Alex Garnett pointed out in their [Write the Docs talk](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2025/speakers/#speaker-alex-garnett-docs-ai-tooling-is-better-and-better-for-us-than-you-think-alex-garnett), "Docs AI tooling is better—and better for us—than you think." They're right; these tools are genuinely useful. But useful as _tools_, not as replacement writers.

The rule: if I can't explain it in my own words, I don't write about it. AI helps me work faster, but everything that matters – the clarity, the working examples, the readable tone – requires a human who knows what they're talking about.
