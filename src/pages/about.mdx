    <p>B.Tech in AI. Got into open-source towards the end of my degree and found things I really enjoyed doing — though I didn't know what to call them at the time. Later learned it's this mix of community building, developer relations, advocacy, evangelism... (yes, [the synonyms for this role are endless](https://youtu.be/_TcU2IITbz4?si=cwUG9-_GBHa0dqIY&t=1297) 😄).</p>

    <p>I spend time integrating different dev-tools and platforms, creating tutorials and guides, and building partnerships between communities. I've been working with notebooks a lot — there's something really satisfying about the interactive, iterative nature of them.</p>

I contribute to projects I use and love, from fixing issues to building integrations. My approach is simple: dogfood platforms extensively, find friction points, then either contribute fixes or create educational content that makes things click for other developers.
