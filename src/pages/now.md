# What I'm Doing Now

*Last updated: November 2025*

## Work

Just started as a Technical Writer at [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com). Getting up to speed on the product, the docs architecture, and figuring out where I can make the biggest impact. Lots of learning, lots of note-taking.

## Writing

Trying to write more consistently. This blog is part of that – a space to share thoughts on notebooks, developer tools, and community building. No fixed schedule yet; still figuring out what works.

## Community

Still volunteering with [SciPy India](https://github.com/scipy-india/), handling speaker outreach, CFP reviewing, etc. for upcoming events. The scientific Python community in India is growing, and it's exciting to be part of that.

## Life

Moved to Chennai. AI grad from [NMIMS](https://www.nmims.edu/). Trying to balance writing, community work, and actually using the tools I write about.
