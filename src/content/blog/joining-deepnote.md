I'm joining Deepnote as a Technical Writer :)

First post on this newly revamped website, figured I'd start with that! Deepnote is a _collaborative_ data notebook platform – think Jupyter, but built for teams working together in the cloud. Came across the role on their careers page and applied. The role aligns well with what I've been doing: that _mix_ of community building, developer advocacy, and technical content creation (you might notice what I wrote on my [About](/about) page about this – I think it aligns well with that).

This seemed like the right moment to revamp my website (previously built with [Hugoblox's academic-theme-cv](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv)) since I'm planning to write more. Wanted a proper blog setup with tags, RSS, and the whole shebang.

Came across [this tweet](https://x.com/tech_optimist/status/1985505977018257776?s=20) from Prashanth Rao about AI-written content versus well-crafted writing – something particularly relevant for Technical Writing.

[Started](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7280386217039319040?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7280386217039319040%29&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3B66KSQLYvSCu95smoLosIRQ%3D%3D) the year off strong with [marimo](https://marimo.io/) (an open-source reactive Python notebook), ending it strong with Deepnote. Grateful for that.

Writing has always been there in some form – documentation, tutorials, markdown inside notebooks, etc. But this time, I want to be more intentional: a space for notes, developer tools, whatever I’m learning, thoughts on tech, or any updates I feel like sharing.

Don't want to make this first post too long. RSS feed is at [haleshot.github.io/rss.xml](/rss.xml) if you want to add it to your Newsletter reader.
