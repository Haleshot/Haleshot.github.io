I'm joining Deepnote as a Technical Writer :)

First post on this newly revamped website, figured I'd start with that! Came across the role on their careers page and applied. The role aligns well with what I've been doing: that _mix_ of community building, developer advocacy, and technical content creation (you might notice what I wrote on my [About](/about) page about this – I think it aligns well with that).

This seemed like the right moment to revamp my website (previously built with [Hugoblox's academic-theme-cv](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv)) since I'm planning to write more. Wanted a proper blog setup with tags, RSS, and the whole shebang.

Came across [this tweet](https://x.com/tech_optimist/status/1985505977018257776?s=20) from Prashanth Rao about AI-written content versus well-crafted writing – something particularly relevant for Technical Writing.

Started the year off strong with marimo, ending it strong with Deepnote. Grateful for that.

Writing has always been there in some form – documentation, tutorials, markdown inside notebooks, etc. But this time, I want to be more intentional: a space for notes, developer tools, whatever I’m learning, thoughts on tech, or any updates I feel like sharing.

Don't want to make this first post too long. RSS feed is at [haleshot.github.io/rss.xml](/rss.xml) if you want to add it to your Newsletter reader.
