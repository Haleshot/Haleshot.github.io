An undergraduate in AI at NMIMS and currently an intern at marimo, where I focus on developer advocacy, open-source, and building communities. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and people — helping developers adopt new tools and collaborating on projects.

Over the past year, I've spent a lot of time working on collaborations and OSS contributions. I like finding ways to integrate different dev-tools and platforms, then creating tutorials/guides or content that makes them more accessible to other developers.

I'm passionate about developer experience, platform research, and finding integration opportunities between different dev-tools. My approach involves dogfooding platforms extensively, identifying friction points, then contributing fixes and creating educational resources that make complex concepts more accessible.
