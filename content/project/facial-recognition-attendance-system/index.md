## Introduction
This automated attendance system utilizes facial recognition technology to replace traditional attendance methods, making it more efficient and hygienic. It provides numerous advantages in various applications, such as attendance recording, access control, and surveillance.

## Advantages of Facial Recognition
- Automated Time Tracking System
- Cost Effective
- Touchless Sign in System
- More accurate Worker Attendance
- Strengthens security measures

## Technical Details
Facial recognition technology involves face detection, data transformation, and face matching. It provides accurate identification and verification based on facial features.

## User Registration
To use the system, users register themselves using a real-time camera. The system detects their face and creates a dataset folder containing user images. Users can also provide additional details such as their roll number and name.

## Marking Attendance
Users can mark their attendance by clicking the "Register Attendance" button. The real-time camera detects the user's face and matches it with the data stored in the dataset folder. If there's a match, attendance data is recorded in an Excel sheet, including the user's ID, name, date, and time.

## Project Overview
Creating this project involved a deep dive into image processing and artificial intelligence. It covered image capture, face detection, dataset management, feature extraction, and recognition algorithms. This project allowed us to gain practical experience in software development and AI.
