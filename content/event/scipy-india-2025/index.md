summary: Presented marimo's reactive notebook architecture and demonstrated how it solves traditional Jupyter notebook problems through dataflow graphs and pure Python storage.
abstract: "Delivered a 30-minute presentation on marimo, an open-source, _reactive_ Python notebook that addresses the [reproducibility crisis](https://leomurta.github.io/papers/pimentel2019a.pdf) in scientific computing. Demonstrated marimo's static analysis, reactive execution and pure Python file format for better Git versioning."
