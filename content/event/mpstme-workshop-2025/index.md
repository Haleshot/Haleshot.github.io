Thanks to the faculty for making this happen; this was the culmination of ongoing effort; two batches back-to-back.

What we did: marimo intro; activation functions primer notebook (dropdowns, sliders, LaTeX, plots); model training via UI; MNIST embedding viz; Molab vs playground (non-WASM vs WASM); widgets via anywidget; switching between slides/app/grid view.

Why it matters: interactive > static PDFs; build your own primers; portfolio-ready apps; OSS contributions encouraged.

Credits: cofounders, mentors and contributors; anywidget by Trevor Manz; widget demos by Vincent.
