I came across marimo from a TL;DR newsletter (finally going through something regularly with passion pays off!) which I have a habit of going through daily for personal interests, passion and curating of resources to use in personal/group projects as I'm an open-source enthusiast who likes contributing too. This exciting discovery immediately caught my attention, promising to revolutionize the way we interact with Python notebooks. Let's dive into what makes marimo so special and how it's addressing long-standing issues in the notebook ecosystem.
