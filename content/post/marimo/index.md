{{< toc >}}

I came across [marimo](https://marimo.io/) from the [TL;DR](https://tldr.tech/) newsletter (finally going through something regularly with passion pays off!) which I have a habit of going through daily; for personal interests, passion and curating of resources to use in personal/group projects as I'm an open-source enthusiast who likes contributing too. This exciting discovery immediately caught my attention, promising to revolutionize the way we interact with Python notebooks (which I associate with regularly). Let's dive into what makes [marimo](https://marimo.io/) so special and how it's addressing long-standing issues in the notebook ecosystem.

{{< toc hide_on="xl" >}}

## 1. What is marimo?

**[marimo](https://marimo.io/)** is a *reactive notebook for Python* that's shaking up the way we think about and interact with computational notebooks. It's not just another Jupyter alternative; it's a ground-up reimagining of what a Python notebook can be.

{{% callout note %}}
At its core, marimo models notebooks as **[Directed Acyclic graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)**, creating a dynamic and interconnected environment for your code.
{{% /callout %}}

How I see the dataflow graph working for marimo:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Cell 1: Define variable] --> B[Cell 2: Use variable]
    A --> C[Cell 3: Use variable]
    B --> D[Cell 4: Use results from Cell 2]
    C --> E[Cell 5: Use results from Cell 3]
    F[UI Element] --> B
    F --> C
    G[Delete Cell] --> H[Scrub variables]
    I[Run Cell] --> J[Auto-run affected cells, unless [lazy](https://docs.marimo.io/api/layouts/lazy.html#lazy) cells]
    K[Update UI Element] --> J
```

Imagine a notebook where running a cell or tweaking a UI element automatically updates all affected parts of your code. That's marimo in action! It keeps your code and outputs in perfect harmony, like a well-orchestrated symphony of data and computations.

But marimo isn't just about reactive execution. It's a multi-faceted tool designed to address some of the most persistent pain points in the notebook ecosystem:
